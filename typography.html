                        <div>
                            Tillana is a Sans-Serif typeface designed by the Indian Type Foundry.
                            It is a unique font that has a hand written feel to it, with a lot of personality and
                            character
                            while supporting both Devanagari and Latin scripts.

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            It has a wide variety of weights ranging from regular to extra bold,
                            making it a versatile typeface that can be used for a variety of design projects.
                            A couple unique details about it is that all the letters are on a 10 degree slant giving it
                            a more dynamic feel and
                            all the vertical strokes have a slight swell in their tops and their bottoms.

                        <div>
                            This site was designed and programmed by Warrington Connor.
                            It showcases the Tilliana typeface throught three different compositions.

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            The first composition uses the typeface to design an image.
                            It uses 5 different characters oriented in different positions to design an abstract image.
                            The second composition showcases what I would think that the natural habitat of the typeface
                            would be.
                            This typeface gave me a more mysterious vibe so I decided to design something that gave a
                            similar mysterious feel.
                            The third composition is just a showcase of the character list and my favourite character in
                            the typeface.
